Investigate:


 -Hardest Courses within lsa  - 3 hardest lsa courses [hard hitting] (GPA metric avg, AVG two most recent semesters (fall and  winter)) 

 -Hardest Department in LSA (based on an median of grades in all courses in a department)  


 -Classes you should wait to take (for fall or winter) [make this more specific] 
[highest discrepency] [list article] all schools (top ten in each school) 


 -Highest ratings in workload for lsa courses. 

 -Classes highest desire to take but the worst work load. 

 -Avg all four of the metrics for each class (new field for satisfaction- generally correlate for being a good class). 






BELOW IGNORE





Does your desire to take a class impact how well you do? [can we figure this out with the data we have?] 


Does your expectations of a class impact how well you do? [related to 4] 


Factors that affect how well you do in a class:

  *answer these questions 
  
      -Does your desire to take a class impact how well you do?
      
      -Does your expectations of a class impact how well you do? 
      
      
The hardest courses in a major, and do other courses get easier? [if your bad at one course does it mean you will be at other courses in a major?[network where the nodes are student grades below B?](question is a work in progress) 


Overall, are the courses in a major what students expect (get the average lowest expectation for classes in a mjor)? (could be cool to investigate this because news can interview students in a major and find out why a majority of courses in a major wasnt what students expected. Also they can see if students are overall happy with the major) 


  -Can use this information and write a follow up article about how could UM can better prepare and explain to students what classes will be like in their major 
  
  
  -were core classes predictive of what a major would be like 
  
  
  key: GPA --> average grade of class
